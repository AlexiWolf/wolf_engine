Provides a high-level input system.

The main job of this crate is to provide a consistent, easy to use, and easy to
test, input system.

It features:

- Input Events.
- Input state.
- Input / Action mapping.
- Adapters for common input APIs. 

The input system is designed mostly for games, and may not be as flexible as
other, more general-purpose input APIs.  If you think something is missing,
feel free to make an issue, or a PR about it.
